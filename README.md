# Microservices Deployment on AWS EKS

In this project, we'll deploy a microservices application on AWS EKS, using Docker for containerization, AWS CodeCommit/GitHub for version control, Jenkins for continuous integration, and CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.
Let's delve into the project's detailed steps.

## Steps To Perform:
1.	Containerize your microservice application using docker
2.	Create 3 Repositories in AWS ECR to Push the docker images into it respectively.
3.	Push the MERN application source code to the CodeCommit repository.
4.	Create a Jenkins Job for building and pushing Docker images to ECR.
5.	Create an Amazon EKS cluster and Use Helm to deploy the code on EKS.

## Prerequisites
Create an EC2 and make below Configures in it.<br>
2. Install & configure aws-cli<br>
   ```
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   sudo apt install unzip
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install -i /usr/local/aws-cli -b /usr/local/bin --update
   ```
3. Install Jenkins in any EC2 server<br>
4. Install docker<br>
   ```
   sudo apt-get update<br>
   sudo apt install docker.io<br>
   docker ps<br>
   sudo chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock<br>
   ```
5. [Install EKSCTL](https://eksctl.io/installation/)<br>
6. [Install Kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html)<br>

## Containerize your microservice application using docker:
- Write Dockerfile for Frontend and Backend Microservices to create an Image.
  Dockerfile For Frontend code.
  ```
  FROM node:18
  WORKDIR /frontend
  COPY . /frontend
  RUN npm install
  EXPOSE 3000
  CMD [ "npm","start" ]
  ```
  Dockerfile for Backend code. Our Backend has 2 serives(/helloserive & /profileservice).
  ```
  *****helloservice*****
  FROM node:18
  WORKDIR /helloservice
  COPY . /helloservice/
  RUN npm install
  EXPOSE 3001
  CMD [ "node","index.js" ]

  *****profileservice*****
  FROM node:18
  WORKDIR /profileservice
  COPY . /profileservice/
  RUN npm install
  COPY . .
  EXPOSE 3002
  CMD [ "node","index.js" ]
  ```
- you can also create an Docker-Compose.yml file, to run and create all three images at same time. 
  ```
  Sudo apt docker-compose = to install docker compose
  docker-compose build = to create images using docker compose
  ```
  
## Create 3 Repositories in AWS ECR to Push the docker images into it respectively:
- *****************Add AWS ECR Full access policy to your IAM user account/User role, so that you can access ECR via your IAM User role.***************
- In AWS ECR, click on Create Repository & create 3 different Public Repositories.

## Push the MERN application source code to the CodeCommit repository:
- To Access AWS CodeCommit , add "AWSCodeCommitFullAccess" policy into your IAM Account "Users" From IAM(Identity and Access Management) service.<br>
  Users --> select your User --> Add permission --> Select AWS code commit Full Access.
![image](https://github.com/SwapnashreeTripathy/MERN-Microservices-EndtoEnd-Deployment/assets/139486876/21e101fd-95b3-4cd9-87f2-b7a405bb1eed)
- Once Policy is added to the IAM account,  Download the “HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit”.<br>
  IAM --> users --> Security Credentials --> HTTPS Git credentials for AWS CodeCommit

- Create a Repository in Codecommit. 
- Connect to EC2(Clone your codes from Github repo to EC2) & Push your MERN Application Code from EC2 to AWS Codecommit by following the below command.
  * Configure codecommit credentials on EC2 .
    ```
    git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'
    git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true
    git init
    git  add .
    git commit -m "comment"
    git remote add codecommit <httprepo-of-codcommit>
    git git push codecommit main(here,main refers to the branch)
    ```

## Create a Jenkins Job for building and pushing Docker images to ECR:

## Create an Amazon EKS cluster and Use Helm to deploy the code on EKS:
- Use the below `deployment.yml` code or `helm chart code` to Create EKS cluster in your AWS region.<br>
  [deployment.yml](https://github.com/SwapnashreeTripathy/MERN-Microservices-EKS-Deployment/blob/main/deployment.yml)<br>
  [helmchart file](https://github.com/SwapnashreeTripathy/MERN-Microservices-EKS-Deployment/tree/main/helmchart)<br>
- in this yaml file, We are creating 2 different PODs with 2 Replicas of each. Our Backend POD will have 2 containers running inside it and Frontend POD will have 1 Container.
- We are also creating 2 different `load balancer` services for backend and fronetend PODS to connect with the outside traffic.
- Now let's run the below commands to create the EKS cluster with region as `Oregeon`.
  
 ```
  eksctl create cluster --name swapna-eks-mern-deployment --region us-west-2 --nodegroup-name swapna-eks-workernodess --node-type t3.medium --nodes 2 --nodes-min 1 --nodes-max 3

  ################################defining the command################################
  eksctl create cluster 
  --name swapna-eks-mern-deployment <name of your Cluster>
  --region us-west-2  <aws region where you want your cluster to create>
  --nodegroup-name swapna-eks-workernodess<define nodegroup/workernode name> 
  --node-type t3.medium <type of EC2 instance/workernode>
  --nodes 2 <desired number of nodes to run>
  --nodes-min 1 
  --nodes-max 3
```
- To update kube-config file.
  ```
  aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name swapna-eks-mern-deployment
  ```
- To run the Deployment.yml file.
  ```
  kubctl Apply -f deploy.yml
  ```
- EKS takes some time to create EKS cluster and all the reatled nodes , so you can view them by going to AWS EKS dashboard or you can run following command to view the same information.
  ```
  kubctl get deployments = to check created deployment
  kubectl get nodes -o wide   = To Check the information about the “NODE”
  kubectl get po -w = check pods
  kubectl get services --watch = check services
  ```

## Setting up CloudWatch monitoring and Create Alarms using SNS:
- To have logs monitored by Cloudwatch for all of the componets of the EKS cluster, let's install Cloudwatch from "Add-ons" on EKS this Cluster.<br>
  so, `CloudWatch` Agent will get installed in each Node running iside the Cluster & it’ll also `Enable Container Insights` in the Cluster so that Cloudwatch will monitor all the Container   
  Insights.<br>
  ![image](https://github.com/SwapnashreeTripathy/MERN-Microservices-EndtoEnd-Deployment/assets/139486876/dfd53508-39ed-4316-bad4-2d555ee5c9c3)

- Go to Cloudwatch, you can view container insights & can set up an Alarm using SNS.
  ![image](https://github.com/SwapnashreeTripathy/MERN-Microservices-EndtoEnd-Deployment/assets/139486876/627b7eac-567b-41a6-ab70-e7c20f7b7a18)
- Let's create an Alarm on PODs to check the status of our containers using SNS Topic.
- Create an SNS Topic and Add notification/Create a Subscription to your email address and subscribe it.
  ![image](https://github.com/SwapnashreeTripathy/MERN-Microservices-EndtoEnd-Deployment/assets/139486876/d246bc74-79c0-4089-aac6-605de013c940)

- To confirm your Subscription go to your email and confirm the subcription and you'll see the status will move to from "pending subscription".

- Now, Create an Alarm from Cloudwatch, by selecting your POD & "POD_Status_failed" metric, to recieve Alerts when 1 or more containers failed.

****We Have Finally completed the Deployment of EKS cluster using Helm chart with docker Containers,used Jenkins for CI and set up Alrams on componets of cluster. Thank you for Visiting my Project!!***
